            I went with fourteen other students <br>for a full month, and it was the best month of my life.<br> Most of
            our trip was spent in Ishinomaki, <br>but we also went to Tokyo several times.

            to Japan:<br> Bring clothes that are warm but don't show too much skin, <br>master a couple
            of Japanese phrases for basic communication, <br>and definitely try Taiyaki (a fish-shaped donut)!</p></div>
